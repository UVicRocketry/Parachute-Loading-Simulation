# Parachute load simulation!

## Description
This python notebook was created to simulate loads created on a rocket during parachute inflation. It calculates an upper bound on the maximum load by assuming the parachute fully inflates instantly. When comparing with a physics simulation engine (Working Model 2D) it produces results within ~5%.

## Setup Guide
Clone this repo and open `Parachute Sim.ipynb` in a text editor that supports Jupyter notebooks (such as VS Code with the Python extension installed). Then, follow the notebook's instructions to set up the simulation and run it. Results are summarized at the bottom of the notebook for easy copy and pasting into your documentation.

Enjoy!
